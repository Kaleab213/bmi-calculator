# bmi_calculator ðŸ’ª

A new Flutter project.

# My Goal 

The objective of this project was to look at how I can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve my own beautiful user interface designs. 

# What I have created 

I made a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by Ruben Vaalt. It is a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
